## ðŸ“Š Database Schema (ER Diagram)

### Entities & Attributes

#### ðŸ‘¤ User
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `userName` (Unique, lowercase)
- `password` (8-100 chars)
- `firstName`
- `lastName`
- `email` (Unique)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

#### ðŸ’° Account
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `userId` (Foreign Key â†’ User.id)
- `balance` (Default: 100.00)
- `vpaAddress` (Unique)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

#### ðŸ’¸ Transaction
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `transactionId` (Unique UUID)
- `senderId` (Foreign Key â†’ User.id)
- `receiverId` (Foreign Key â†’ User.id)
- `amount` (Decimal 10,2)
- `description` (Text)
- `status` (ENUM: pending, completed, failed)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

#### ðŸ”” Notification
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `userId` (Foreign Key â†’ User.id)
- `transactionId` (Foreign Key â†’ Transaction.id)
- `message` (Text)
- `read` (Boolean, Default: false)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt`

### Relationships

```
User (1) â”€â”€â”€ (1) Account
   â”‚
   â”œâ”€â”€ (1:N) â”€â”€â”€ (N) Transaction (as sender)
   â”œâ”€â”€ (1:N) â”€â”€â”€ (N) Transaction (as receiver)
   â”‚
   â””â”€â”€ (1:N) â”€â”€â”€ (N) Notification

Transaction (1) â”€â”€â”€ (1:N) Notification
```

### Key Relationships Explained

#### User â†” Account (One-to-One)
- Each user has exactly one account
- Account belongs to one user
- Account gets 100.00 initial balance

#### User â†” Transaction (One-to-Many, Bidirectional)
- User can send many transactions (as sender)
- User can receive many transactions (as receiver)
- Each transaction has one sender and one receiver

#### User â†” Notification (One-to-Many)
- User can have many notifications
- Each notification belongs to one user

#### Transaction â†” Notification (One-to-Many)
- Each transaction can generate multiple notifications
- Each notification relates to one transaction

### Business Logic
- **VPA (Virtual Payment Address)**: Unique identifier for money transfers
- **Transaction Flow**: Sender's balance decreases, receiver's balance increases atomically
- **Notification System**: Real-time updates for transaction events
- **Security**: Password validation, JWT authentication, secure transaction processing

### Database Design Highlights
âœ… **Normalized Structure** - No data redundancy
âœ… **Referential Integrity** - Foreign key constraints
âœ… **Indexing** - Optimized for VPA lookups and user queries
âœ… **Atomic Transactions** - Database-level transaction support
âœ… **Audit Trail** - Timestamps on all entities
